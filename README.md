# current-conveyor

An LTspice project which contains a third-order Butterworth filter built using an inductor and alternatively a current conveyor made of ideal voltage and current buffers with LTspice. The scripts plot the frequency responses of both ideal designs on the same graph when simulated.

This project was assigned for the Computer Tools for Electrical Engineers (EE 241) course on Fall 2020-21 semester.
